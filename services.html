            <hr>
            <p>Think about what expenses would need to be covered in the event of your death. Things like mortgage, college tuition, and other debts, not to mention funeral expenses. Plus, income replacement is a major factor if your spouse or loved ones
                need cash flow and are not able to provide it on their own.</p>
            <div class="lead">

                <h3>
                    Benefits of Life Insurance</h3>
                <p> There are many benefits to having life insurance. Below are some of the most important features and protections offered by life insurance policies. Most people use life insurance to provide money to beneficiaries who would suffer a financial
                    hardship upon the insured’s death. However, for wealthy individuals, the tax advantages of life insurance, including the tax-deferred growth of cash value, tax-free dividends, and tax-free death benefits, can provide additional strategic
                    opportunities. Avoiding Taxes—the death benefit of a life insurance policy is usually tax-free.Wealthy individuals sometimes buy permanent life insurance within a trust to help pay the estate taxes that will be due upon their death.
                    This strategy helps to preserve the value of the estate for their heirs. Tax avoidance is a law-abiding strategy for minimizing one’s tax liability and should not be confused with tax evasion, which is illegal.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Who Needs Life Insurance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Life insurance provides financial support to surviving dependents or other beneficiaries after the death of an insured policyholder. Here are some examples of people who may need life insurance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents with minor children—if a parent dies, the loss of their income or caregiving skills could create a financial hardship. Life insurance can make sure the kids will have the financial resources they need until they can support
                        themselves.
                    </li>
                    <li> Parents with special-needs adult children—for children who require lifelong care and will never be self-sufficient, life insurance can make sure their needs will be met after their parents pass away. The death benefit can be used to
                        fund a special needs trust that a fiduciary will manage for the adult child’s benefit</li>
                    <li> Adults who own property together—married or not, if the death of one adult would mean that the other could no longer afford loan payments, upkeep, and taxes on the property, life insurance may be a good idea. One example would be an
                        engaged couple who take out a joint mortgage to buy their first house.</li>
                    <li> Seniors who want to leave money to adult children who provide their care—many adult children sacrifice time at work to care for an elderly parent who needs help. This help may also include direct financial support. Life insurance can
                        help reimburse the adult child’s costs when the parent passes away. </li>
                    <li>Young adults whose parents incurred private student loan debt or cosigned a loan for them—young adults without dependents rarely need life insurance, but if a parent will be on the hook for a child’s debt after their death, the child
                        may want to carry enough life insurance to pay off that debt.</li>
                    <li>
                        Children or young adults who want to lock in low rates—the younger and healthier you are, the lower your insurance premiums. A 20-something adult might buy a policy even without having dependents if there is an expectation to have them in the future.</li>
                    <li>
                        Stay at home spouses - stay at home spouse should have life insurance as they have significant economic value based on the work they do in the home. According to Salary.com, the economic value of a stay at home parent would have been equivalent to an
                        annual salary of $162,581 in 2018.</li>
                    <li> Wealthy families who expect to owe estate taxes—life insurance can provide funds to cover the taxes and keep the full value of the estate intact. </li>
                    <li>Families who can’t afford burial and funeral expenses—a small life insurance policy can provide funds to honor a loved one’s passing.</li>
                    <li> Businesses with key employees—if the death of a key employee, such as a CEO, would create a severe financial hardship for a firm, that firm may have an insurable interest that will allow it to purchase a life insurance policy on that
                        employee.
                    </li>
                    <li>Married pensioners—instead of choosing between a pension payout that offers a spousal benefit and one that doesn’t, pensioners can choose to accept their full pension and use some of the money to buy life insurance to benefit their
                        spouse. This strategy is called pension maximization. Those with preexisting conditions—such as cancer, diabetes, or smoking. Note, however, that some insurers may deny coverage for such individuals, or else charge very high rates.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3> What are the benefits of life insurance? </h3>
                <p>Payouts are tax-free—death benefits are paid as a lump sum and are not subject to federal income tax because they are not considered income for beneficiaries. Dependents don't have to worry about living expenses—most policy calculators
                    recommend a multiple of your gross income equal to seven to 10 years that can cover major expenses like mortgages and college tuition without the surviving spouse or children having to take out loans. Final expenses can be covered—funeral
                    expenses can be significant and can be avoided with a burial policy or with standard term or permanent life policies. Policies can supplement retirement savings—permanent life policies such as whole, universal, and variable life insurance
                    can offer cash value in addition to death benefits, which can augment other savings in retirement. How do you qualify for life insurance? Life insurance is available to anyone, but the cost or premium level can vary greatly based on
                    the risk level an individual presents based on factors like age, health, and lifestyle. Life insurance applications generally require the customer to provide medical records and medical history and submit to a medical exam. Some types
                    of life insurance such as guaranteed approval life don't require medical exams, but generally, have much higher premiums and involve an initial waiting period before taking effect and offering a death benefit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>How does life insurance work?</h3>
                <p> Life insurance policies all offer a death benefit in exchange for paying premiums to the insurance provider during the term of the policy. One popular type of life insurance—term life insurance— only lasts for a set amount of time, such
                    as 10 or 20 years during which the policyholder needs to offset the financial impact of losing income. Permanent life insurance also features a death benefit but lasts for the life of the policyholder as long as premiums are maintained
                    and can include cash value that builds over time.</p>

            <p>The above graph represents actual data from 1998
                to 2016 showing how the S&P 500 compared to a
                Fixed Indexed Annuity. Notice the market recessions in 2002 and 2008/2009. When will the next
                recession hit?</p>

                <h3>Q: Will I outlive my retirement?</h3>
            </i>
            <span><h4>A: Never Outlive Your Money</h4>
            <p>Annuities & Stock Mix is a Proven Plan! A former
                professor of finance at Yale University, Roger G.
                Ibbotson, who founded Ibbotson Associates,
                released a statistical financial study in which they
                compared with mathematical algorithms which
                retirement approach allowed the longest returns
                assuming a 4% annual withdrawal. The results were
                clear that a 50/50% weighted annuity & stocks/
                bonds mix was the best approach for retirement.
                This is the reason that more money was allocated
                into Fixed and Fixed Indexed Annuities last year
                than ever before.</p>
